# /Site

I love reading other people's websites and how they build them. So here is my own **/site!**

This website is built with Hugo. It lives on Github and is somehow converted to a website via Netlify. Donâ€™t ask me how it works, it just does. And itâ€™s free. ðŸŽ‰

The design of this website is... well, simple. Websites need to be fast and simple to read and navigate. Zero cookies, javascript or other crap.
