Hi, Iâ€™m Jan-Willem and have a cat named Bob. I have no need for a website, but here we are.

I work at Sunrise Medical, where I build stuff for the web, among other cool things. 

### This website

This website is powered by Hugo, Netlify and Github. Everytime I add or change something, Netlify does it's magic. It's free, fast and reasonably easy.

And I promise: no cookies, javascript or other crap. I don't care about visitor numbers.
