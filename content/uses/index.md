A simple list of the stuff I like to use.

- **M1 Mac Mini**  
16gb / 512gb. This is my main computer. Coming from a MacBook Pro from 2017 that I did not like at all, this thing is great. It's fast, silent and does everything I want.

- **LG 27UD88-W**  
4K & USB C.

- **Aukey USB C Hub**  
Because one has never enough USB ports.

- **Yubico NFC Key**  

- **Leopold FC750R**  
Still my favorite keyboard.

- **Logitech G502 Hero**

- **OnePlus Nord**  
256gb. Looking into de-googling it.

- **Canon G7X Mark II**  
I have a Canon 70D, but my main camera is the G7X. I love this thing. It's small, takes great photos and is super fast to control.
