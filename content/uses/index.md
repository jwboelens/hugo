# Uses

### Hardware

**M1 Mac Mini**  
16gb / 512gb. This is my main computer. Coming from a MacBook Pro from 2017 that I did not like at all, this thing is great. It's fast, silent and does everything I want.

**Leopold FC750R**  
Still my favorite keyboard.

**Logitech G502 Hero**

**OnePlus Nord**  
256gb. Looking into de-googling it.
