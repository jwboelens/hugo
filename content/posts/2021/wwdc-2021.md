- All the FaceTime stuff does not matter here in the Netherlands. Nobody uses FaceTime.
- Improvements to Messages. Same story as FaceTime.
- Focus. Finally better notifications on iOS.
- Photo Memories. Meh.
- Wallet. Only in the US. As always.
- Maps. Again. Useless for where I live.
- iPad stuff. I you want a computer, buy a computer.
- Safari. I don't know about this one. Have to try it.
