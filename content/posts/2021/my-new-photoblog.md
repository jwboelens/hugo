# My New Photoblog

Are you old enough to remember the term photoblog? Just a simple page with some photos and an archive with thumbnails.

Some of my favorites were [chromogenic.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20050208013240/http://chromogenic.net/) and [daily dose of imagery](http://wvs.topleftpixel.com/).

No albums, just a stream of photos. I decided I need to make my own photoblog on my own website. No snapstagramâ„¢ for me.

### Hosting

This turned out to be the most difficult problem: where to put the actual photos. My website is hosted on Github/Netlify but I didn't want my photos there, mainly because of the workflow. Or the lack thereof.

I've used bunny.net as a cdn before and they have a image optimizer which is very cool, but costs $9.50 a month. That's too much for a simple photoblog.

I could also use WordPress but for a simple photoblog, that was too much hassle and I knew there should be an easier way.

### Blot

Then I remembered [blot.im](https://blot.im). 

Blot is a blogging service that turns a Dropbox folder into a website. You connect Blot to Dropbox, upload markdown, text files or images, and voila: you have a website. It really is that simple.

I chose the simplest template there was and made it even simpler by stripping away everything I did not need: titles, tags and dates. I only wanted to show the photos.

So now, if I want to post a photo on my photoblog, I upload the photo to the correct Dropbox folder and Blot takes care of the rest.
