In the last couple of weeks there have been an number of people writing blog posts about them leaving the email service Hey and going back to Gmail or any of their previous email providers. 

Reason being that Hey is either: made by Basecamp, which is a terrible company or people are finally finding out that Hey is just an email service like any other with better marketing.

To the people that think that switching email providers helps you dealing with email: **it doesn't**.

It's still email. It's not that hard.

If switching to Hey made you go through your email workflow and streamlining it, you don't need Hey for that.
