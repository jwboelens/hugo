In the last couple of weeks there have been an number of people writing blog posts about them leaving the email service Hey and going back to Gmail or any of their previous email providers. 

Reason being that Hey is either: made by Basecamp, which is a terrible company or people are finally finding out that Hey is just an email service like any other with better marketing.

To the people that think that switching email providers helps you dealing with email: **it doesn't**.

It's still email. It's not that hard. Email comes in. Email goes out.

If switching to Hey made you go through all your email subscriptions and cutting some out, you don't need Hey for that.

### Tips

Dealing with email is not that difficult: there are only a couple of things you can do with a message.

1. If you read the email and think: I've read it, I don't need it anymore, **delete it**.
2. If you read the email and think: this could be usefull someday, **archive it**.
3. If it takes you one minute or less to reply or take action, **do it**.
4. If you don't have time to deal with it now, schedule time in your calendar to do it.

Oh and here is a free bonus tip:
stop reading your email 50 times a day. Read your email at the beginning and end of the day. That's all you need.
