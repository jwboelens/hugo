Hi, Iâ€™m Jan-Willem. I have a cat named Bob. I have no need for a website, but here we are.

I ~~hate all~~ donâ€™t have any social media.

Taking photographs is one of my longest running hobbies. 
You can look at some of the photos I take at <a href="https://photos.janwillem.xyz">photos.janwillem.xyz</a>.

I like looking at stuff other people use so I made my own list: <a href="/uses">/uses</a>.

This website is built with Hugo. It lives on Github and is somehow converted to a website via Netlify. 
Don't ask me how it works, it just does. And it's free. ðŸŽ‰
