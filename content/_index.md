This blog serves as my way to give back to all of the people who taught me
something over my career. It all started in 2007 when I needed a way to keep
track of all the information I learned during my daily work as a systems
administrator.

Most posts are highly technical, but there are also ports about launching your
career, improving your life, and even dabbling in the stock market. I hope you
find the content here useful and I am always open to feedback.

Taking photographs is one of my longest running hobbies. 
You can look at some of the photos I take at <a href="https://photos.janwillem.xyz">photos.janwillem.xyz</a>.

This website is built with Hugo. It lives on Github and is somehow converted to a website via Netlify. 
Don't ask me how it works, it just does. And it's free. ðŸŽ‰
