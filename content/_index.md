This blog serves as my way to give back to all of the people who taught me
something over my career. It all started in 2007 when I needed a way to keep
track of all the information I learned during my daily work as a systems
administrator.

Most posts are highly technical, but there are also ports about launching your
career, improving your life, and even dabbling in the stock market. I hope you
find the content here useful and I am always open to feedback.

The blog comes from content in my [GitHub repository] and it builds in GitHub
Actions using Hugo. From there, GitHub Pages serves up the site behind
Cloudflare. This is a great low-cost method for hosting a blog _(perhaps I
should write a post on that)_. 🤔
