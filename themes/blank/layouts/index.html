<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Jan-Willem and have a cat named Bob. I have no need for a website, but here we are.</p>

<p>I work at Sunrise Medical, where I build stuff for the web, among other cool things.</p>

<p>I have no social media.</p>

<hr>

<p>This website is build with Hugo which lives on Github and is deployed by Netlify. I don't know what any of that means, but it's working.</p>
